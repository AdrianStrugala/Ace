Surely [May Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_day#England) is nothing at all to do with 'international labour solidarity' but is in fact an very old holiday more to do with paganism and christianity than anything else (unless Morris Dancing has some subtle meaning I'm not aware of?)
you've gotta be careful with stuff like this, though. when teachers used gimmicks like that when i was a kid, i just felt insulted, like they thought we were a herd of dumb sheeple (which most of the kids were, granted, but still).
