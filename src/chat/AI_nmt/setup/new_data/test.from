I do when I'm on the computer. My hand just gravitates to the waist band of my pants/panties and sits just under them. I don't do anything, it just sits there. 
Ah, so I'm not the only one completely disgusted by that show. They make normal toddlers look like plastic life-sized dolls. And the mothers are crazy as hell. Not to mention some of those girls are starting to develop the all-feared drama-queen syndrome *shudder*
