I sure wish there was some sort of Community Promise or something that covered enough .NET to make useful apps in this and other contexts...oh wait there is.
And regardless, I'm for our boys.  Until the Federal government brings them home, I want them to win every battle in this senseless war.  If some kids who have no say in international politics are gonna die, it's better their boys than ours.  
So puberty prevents the pestering pedophile pope from peeking in your pants, then?

actually I've reverse engineered Spirit, and interestingly, due to it's difference from Pwnage and the nature of the exploit(s) used, an iTunes update would do absolutely **nothing** to block Spirit. it simply can't. an iPhoneOS update on the other hand can definitely fix it.
Done it. Awesome.
I can't even imagine what it feels like for that guy to take a shit.

FUCK. If you are going to make up a disease use -osis. It basically means nothing, save 'a disease that has something to do with (subject)'. -itis means 'inflammation of the (subject)'. This is one of my biggest pet peeves.

I don't think it'll help too much. The planning of real life cities is dominated by politics. I doubt any pie-in-the-sky advanced planning strategies would get past all the committees, councils, NIMBYs etc.

After some thought, that makes good sense. Mr. Rogers was a teetotaler because if he drank, he would become *far, far too awesome*.

... and being able to lie convincingly when put on the spot is not a trick everyone's good at, regardless of how old it is.  It's also stressful to many people.
